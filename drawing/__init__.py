# dunno if making emtpy __init__ just so i can have a package
# is good practice/style, but i just want to keep class files
# organized okay

# this folder has stuff related to drawing. if screen_elements
# turns out to be the only file i need (top notch planning lol),
# i guess i'll move it into classes and that can just be the
# classes folder and not folder for course/mark stuff
